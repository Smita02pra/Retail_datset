# Retail_datset

## 📊 Retail Sales Data Analysis (Beginner-Friendly)

This project involves cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a messy retail dataset using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**. It's designed to replicate a real-world data analyst task and is especially suited for students and aspiring data analysts.

---

### 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes sales data from a fictional retail store with the following columns:

* `Order_ID`, `Customer_Name`, `City`, `Product`, `Quantity`, `Price_per_unit`
* `Order_Date`, `Payment_Method`, `Discount(%)`, `Returned`

It contains:

* Missing values
* Duplicates
* Inconsistent capitalization
* Opportunities for feature engineering (like Total Revenue)

---

### 🔧 Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook 

---

### 📌 Project Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting
   * Normalize categorical data
   * Create a new feature: `Total_Amount`

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Revenue analysis by city, product, and customer
   * Filter orders based on multiple conditions
   * Monthly trends and performance

3. **Statistical Analysis with NumPy**

   * Mean, standard deviation, percentiles
   * Data normalization
   * Condition-based comparisons

4. **Data Visualization with Matplotlib**

   * Bar charts, pie charts, line plots, histograms

---

### 📌 Sample Questions Solved

* What are the top 5 cities by total sales?
* Which products were sold the most?
* What is the average order value per month?
* Which customers spent the most?
* How many orders were returned?
* What is the 90th percentile price per unit?
* What is the monthly trend of revenue?

---

### 📈 Key Visualizations

* 📊 Bar chart: Monthly revenue
* 📉 Line plot: Average Order Value (AOV)
* 🥧 Pie chart: Payment methods
* 🧮 Histogram: Total transaction amounts
